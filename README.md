# DotsSway
Simply my sway config. Its the default one with some changes and waybar implementation, nothing more.
Remember to install grim for screenshots (they will get redirected to your Pictures folder) and brightnessctl for changing the brightness of you screen with your keys.
# In archlinux
  sudo pacman -S grim brightnessctl
# In debian (I guess)
  apt install grim brightnessctl


I actually don't know what I'm doing, I'm bored.
I will upload my dots tomorrow. I need to study. #02-03-2025 DD-MM-YYYY
