Pleeeeeeeease, just ignore the license file and the readme, they are not useful for individuals like you and me, garbage, just ignore it.
# DotsSway
Simply my sway config. Its the default one with some changes and waybar implementation and a shortcut for pavucontrol with $mod(homekey)+Shift+v.
Remember to install grim for screenshots (they will get redirected to your Pictures folder) and brightnessctl for changing the brightness of you screen with your keys.
# In archlinux
  sudo pacman -S grim brightnessctl pavucontrol
# In debian (I guess)
  sudo apt install grim brightnessctl pavucontrol


I actually don't know what I'm doing, I'm bored.
I will upload my dots tomorrow. I need to study. #02-03-2025 DD-MM-YYYY
